# ConstellationEye (Const-Eye)

## Overview
ConstellationEye (Const-Eye) is an interactive laboratory for exoplanet discovery. This project uses AI/ML models to analyze NASA light curve datasets (Kepler, TESS) to identify potential exoplanets. The goal is to make space exploration accessible and educational, combining real data with interactive visualizations.

## Features
- Load and explore real exoplanet light curves.
- Run AI/ML models to detect possible exoplanets.
- Visualize transits and model predictions.
- Educational dashboard to learn about the detection process.

## Tech Stack (still in plan)
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, XGBoost
- **Data:** NASA Exoplanet Archive, MAST, Kaggle datasets
- **Frontend:** Plotly/D3.js for interactive visualization, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS
- **Deployment:** Docker
